# GN Manager Suite - Tools Directory

Welcome to the command center of the GN Manager Suite. This directory contains the complete arsenal of specialized, high-performance command-line tools engineered by **GeekNeuron**. Each script is a master of its domain, designed to be powerful independently, yet work in harmony as part of a cohesive ecosystem.

## First Steps & General Usage

1.  **Unified Location:** For the suite to function correctly, all `.bat` files must be kept in the same folder.
2.  **Main Entry Point:** The recommended way to start is by running `GN_Manager_Suite.bat`, which provides a central menu to access all other tools.
3.  **Administrator Rights:** All tools require administrative privileges to perform their tasks. They will automatically request elevation if not run as an administrator.
4.  **Automatic Setup:** On the first run of any tool, a configuration file (`GN_Manager_Config.ini`) and a log file (`GN_Manager_Log.txt`) will be created automatically in the same directory.
