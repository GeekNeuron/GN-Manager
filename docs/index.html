            <h2>About The Project</h2>
            <p>
                The GN Manager project was born out of the need for a powerful, centralized, and intelligent solution for Windows power users. Instead of relying on a single, monolithic script, the suite is architected as a collection of four specialized, high-performance tools that work in harmony. This modular design ensures that each tool is an expert in its domain, providing a clean, focused, and robust user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                From modern online package management to deep system cleaning and vital data protection, GN Manager provides a comprehensive toolkit for developers, system administrators, and anyone who wants to take full control of their Windows environment. Explore the full project and its source code on the official <a href="https://github.com/GeekNeuron/GN-Manager" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
