            <h2>About The Project</h2>
            <p>
                GN Manager is a comprehensive solution for Windows power users. Instead of a single, monolithic script, it's a suite of four specialized, high-performance tools that work in harmony. The suite includes the <strong>GN Winget Install Manager</strong> for modern online installations, the <strong>GN Local Install Manager</strong> for rapid offline setups, the <strong>GN Cleaner Manager</strong> for deep system cleaning, and the <strong>GN Backup Manager</strong> for vital data and settings protection. Each tool is designed to be powerful on its own, but together they form the ultimate toolkit for Windows automation.

                    <p>A comprehensive system hygiene tool for meticulously uninstalling applications and removing all their traces. It goes beyond the standard uninstaller by deep-scanning for leftover files (which it safely moves to a quarantine folder) and orphaned registry keys (deleting them with your explicit, per-key confirmation).</p>

                    <p>The ultimate safety net and time-saver for developers and power users. This utility allows you to define backup profiles for your most complex applications (like IDEs or creative software) in a simple config file. It can then export all their critical data, settings, plugins, and even registry keys, allowing you to restore your entire workspace environment in minutes on a new installation.</p>
