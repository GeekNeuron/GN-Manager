Welcome to **GN Manager**, a powerful and professional suite of command-line tools designed to streamline and automate software management on Windows. Authored by **GeekNeuron**, this suite provides a galactic-level toolset for power users, developers, and system administrators.

## Key Features

The GN Manager suite is composed of four specialized, yet integrated, tools:

-   **GN Winget Install Manager:** For modern, online software installation and upgrading via the official Windows Package Manager.
-   **GN Local Install Manager:** For rapid, offline installation of software from a local folder of installers.
-   **GN Cleaner Manager:** A comprehensive tool for uninstalling applications and deep-cleaning leftover files and registry entries.
-   **GN Backup Manager:** A vital utility for backing up and restoring application data, settings, and registry keys, saving hours of reconfiguration.
